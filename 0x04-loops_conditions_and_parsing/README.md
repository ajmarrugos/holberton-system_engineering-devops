## Bash: Loops, Conditions & Parsing

Project to look in to Basic Bash Scripting
All files should pass the ShellCheck coding style.

This project is helpful to:

- Authenticate trough SSH Protocol using the SSH keygen to create a RSA public key 
- Create Scripts that are portable between many enviroments
- Implement loops, conditionals and case statements in Bash scripting
- Create useful scripts to recognize and manipulate outputs

Here the list of functions implemented in the exercise:

| Files/Functions               | Use/Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-RSA_public_key.pub          | A RSA public key to connect to Holberton's Intranet                        |
| 1-for_best_school             | Will display "Best School" 10 times using the 'for' loop                   |
| 2-while_best_school           | Same as last, but using the 'while' loop                                   |
| 3-until_best_school           | Same as last, but using the 'until' conditional                            |
| 4-if_9_say_hi                 | Same as last, but using the 'while' loop and the 'if' conditional          |
| 5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance | Will check the number 'i' and display text in certain conditions           |
| 6-superstitious_numbers       | Same as last, but using the'while' loop and the 'case" statement           |
| 7-clock                       | Will return a count of minutes and hours                                   |
| 8-for_ls                      | Will list just the name of files in current directory                      |
| 9-to_file_or_not_to_file      | Bash script that gives you info about the 'school' file                    |
| 10-fizzbuzz                   | Will display 'Fizz', 'Buzz' or 'FizzBuzz' in certain multples of the count |
